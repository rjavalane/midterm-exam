Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. The java life cycle is defined as below:
  1-Editing hte programme: Start with typing the programme in a text editor and then save it as a .java extension file.
  2-Compiling the source code:In the compiling part the javac takes the input (source code) and transforms it into an output that will be a bytecode and generates a .class file.
  3-Executing the bytecode: The bytecode generated by the compiler will at this step be executed by Java virtual Machine(JVM) and generate a binary code that will be executed by the CPU of the local machine.

what is class?
A. A class is  a template used to create object and to  define object data types and methods.

What is object?
A. Object is instance of a class by which we can access the data members and member functions of the class.

What is the entry point of an application?
A. Is the main methode.

Why main is static?
A. The main is static so that JVM can invoke it without instantiating the claas and to save the unnecessary wastage of memory.


Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A. Object is the super class of all classes.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A. Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find hte executables, classpath is an environment variable which is used by the java compiler to find the path.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. An Interface only allows to define functionality, not implement it.
      Abstract class: allows to create functionality that subclass can implement or override.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. we cannot create an object of abstract class or interface since they are incomplete class.
   and we use it: interface name object name =new class name

What is Access Specifier?
A. Access specifier help the visibility restriction of a package, class,  methods, variables or data members. they are also called visibility specifiers.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. OOP stands for Object oriented Programming,
   Inheritance : is a concept that acquires the properties from one class to other classes.
   Polymorphism: is the ability of an object to take many forms. It allows to perform the same action in many different ways.
   Encapsulation: is the data hiding.
   Abstraction: is implementation hiding.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. Java package is collection of classes and interfaces. The package that is imported by default is: java.lang package.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. API stands for Application programming interface and it is a way to programmatically interact with a separate software component or resource.
   I use APIs like cloud, research websites, chat websites, Android applications...

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. java does not support multiple inheritances because the subclass can not have multiple super classes, that can produce code errors.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A.method overloading is when two methods have same name but different number os parameters, it is happening during the compile time.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions,
   we can use try and catch and throw to handle exceptions.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A.In the Java programming language, the keyword static is used to share the same variable or method of a given class.
 It is mainly used for memory management.
 It is used for a constant variable or a method that is the same for every instance if a class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A.Final is a keyword and access modifier that is used to apply restrictions on a class, methode or variable.
Once declared final, the value of the variable cannot be changed(it will be constant), and once a method is declared final it cannot be overridden by subclass.


What is final, finally and finalize?
A.Final means the value is final, finally is a block that is executed after catch block and finalize is used for garbage collection.

  Final is a keyword and access modifier that is used to apply restrictions on a class, methode or variable.
  Finally is the block in Java Exception Handling to execute the important code whether the exception occurs or not.
  Finalize is the method in Java which is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.

What is a constructor ?
A.A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A.Yes, we can have multiple constructors in a class

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. If we don't have a constructor declared, the default constructor is called during the object creation.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A. "this" keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A. "super" keyword in java refers to superclass objects.

What is JVM stand for ?
A. Java Virtual Machine

Is JVM platform independent?
A.no it is not independent and it depends on the JRE which depends on the JDK.

What version of java are you using?
A. JDK 17

What is JAR stand for ?
A.  JAR stands for Java ARchives

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A.JDK is a software development kit to develop applications in Java and JVM executes java byte codes and provides environment to execute it.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A. JVM executes byte codes and provides environment to execute it and JRE is part of the Java Development kit(JDK) and is a set of component to create and run a Java application.

What is compile time and run time?
A.Compile time when the programming code is converted to a machine code(binary code) and the run time is when the programme is running and it generally occurs after the compile time.

What is heap?
A. Heap is i a dynamique memory that is used to create instance or variable.

How java manage it's memory?
A. Java is managing it's memory by using stack memory,heap memory and garbage collection.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A. String is immutable class while StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable classes.
   StringBuffer is thread-safe and synchronised while StringBuilder is not.
   StringBuffer is faster than StringBuilder.

What is Singleton class?
A. A singleton class is a class that can have only one object at a time and it is used to protect class and objects.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A.Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
  Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.

when to use transient variable in java?
A.Transient is a variable modifier that is used in serialization when we do not want to save a value of a particular variable in a file.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A.While loop check the condition first then executes the statement, do...while loop executes the statement then check the condition.

What is Enum?
A. An enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants. The variable must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it.
  Common examples include compass directions (values of NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, and WEST) and the days of the week.

What is Iterator?
A.An iterator is an object that has methods that allow you to proccess a collection of items one at a time.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A. integer will take more memory.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
A.String in Java is immutable which means once you create a String object the content of that string cannot be modified.
  The key benefits of keeping this class as immutable are caching, security, synchronization, and performance.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
A. Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A. Serial is a singlethread: the deletion of the objects are done one after the other. parallel is multi-thread: the deletion of the objects are done at the same time.

What is JIT stands for?
A.Just In Time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A. Heap space is the available memory for storing object, Garbage collection is the deletion of all unused objects to clear space for new objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A.No, garbage collection does not guarantee that the programme will not run out of memory because it only clears space from deleting unused objects.
  Thus, we can have a programme free of unused objects and no memory space can be cleared.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A.Stack is only used for the method while heap is used throughout the application.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A.reflection is a feature in Java programming that allows an executing java programme to examine or introspect upon itself, and manipulate internal properties of the program.

A.MySql dependencies, mangoDb dependencies and Junit dependencies

what is dependency injection in java?
A.Dependency injection is the concept in which objects get other required objects from outside.
  Dependency injection can be implemented in any programming language. The general concept behind dependency injection is called Inversion of Control.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A. The static binding uses Type information for binding while Dynamic binding uses Objects to resolve to bind.
   Static binding is used to resolve Overloading methods and dynamique binding is used in overridden methods.
